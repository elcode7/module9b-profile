## Description
This is a React app built with Vite. It contains a profile component styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned
- How to use JSX
- How to style with inline CSS
- How to create and render functional components

## Challenges
One issue I encountered was importing and rendering the UserProfile component correctly in App.jsx. At first, I forgot to export the component properly and received an error in the browser. I resolved this by adding export default UserProfile; at the bottom of the file and ensuring the import path in App.jsx was correct.
